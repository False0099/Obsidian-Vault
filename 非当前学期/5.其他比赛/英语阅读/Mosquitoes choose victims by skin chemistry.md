Mosquitoes are humans’ most **lethal** predators, carrying diseases such as **malaria**, yellow fever and dengue fever that kill more than half a million people each year. Anopheles gambiae, one of the species that carry malaria, is a particularly **menacing** hunter. There are various estimates of how far the mosquitoes fly, but they tend to **range** less than half a mile a day, according to one study from West Africa. They typically feed around midnight, flying into the open **eaves** of people’s homes. In Zambia, 2,000 people die from malaria each year.

蚊子是对人类最致命的捕食动物，它们携带疟疾、黄热病和登革热等疾病，每年导致50多万人死亡。冈比亚按蚊是携带疟疾的品种之一，属于尤为危险的捕食者。蚊子能飞多远，有很多不同的估计，但根据西非的一项研究，它们每天飞行的距离往往不到半英里。它们通常在午夜左右进食，从人们家里敞开的屋檐中。赞比亚每年有2000人死于疟疾。

  

To find out how these mosquitoes **stalk** their sleeping victims, scientists built an outdoor testing arena about the size of two tennis courts, or 2,000 times the size of a typical laboratory setup. They let the mosquitoes **acclimate to** their open-air laboratory. Then, the researchers did everything they could to **conjure** the right mood.

**Stalk**
***N.茎***
She trimmed the **stalks** of the tulips before putting them in a vase.

**acclimate to**
***V.适应***


**Conjure**
***V.变魔术***
In an instant, the magician had **conjured** (up) a dove from his hat.


为了弄清楚这些蚊子是如何盯上睡眠中的受害者的，科学家们建了一个户外测试区域，大约为两个网球场那么大，是常规实验室配置的2000倍大。他们让蚊子适应露天实验室。然后，研究人员竭尽所能地唤起蚊子的合适的状态。

  

At stations scattered around the arena, air conditioning **ducts** delivered the **bouquet** of different humans sleeping in nearby tents. At each station, the piped-in **aromas** **suffused** hot plates warmed to human body temperature, alongside **puffs** of carbon dioxide. With an infrared camera, scientists watched which hot plates became mosquito discos. They found that heat and carbon dioxide weren’t enough to attract the insects without the added element of human body odor.

**Ducts**
***N.管道***
People with blocked tear **ducts** cannot cry.

**bouquet**
***N.一束***

**aromas**
***N.香气***

**Suffuse**
***V.弥漫***
His voice was low and **suffused** with passion.



分散在整个实验区域的各个站点中，空调管道传送着附近帐篷里的不同人的气味。每个站点，由管道传送过来的气味弥散在加热到人体体温的热盘子上，旁边还有阵阵二氧化碳。科学家们借助红外摄像机观察哪些热盘子变成了蚊子的蹦迪现场。他们发现如果没有添加人体气味，热量和二氧化碳不足以吸引蚊子。

“This study adds a lot,” said Leslie Vosshall, a neurobiologist and chief scientific officer of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, whose laboratory recently discovered that skin chemistry determined whether people were mosquito magnets for a different species, Aedes aegypti, that carries yellow fever.



霍华德·休斯医学研究所的神经生物学家兼首席科学官莱斯利·沃斯肖说，“这项研究补充了很多东西。”沃斯肖的实验室最近发现，皮肤化学物质决定了人是否吸引另一个品种的蚊子，即携带黄热病的埃及伊蚊。

​

The study found that the mosquitoes were particularly **attuned to** the oily **secretions** that **hydrate** skin and protect it from microbes. Chemical compounds called carboxylic acids are a strong draw.  “What really matters to the mosquito is not the most abundant type of chemical, it’s really those chemical interactions and relative abundances,” said Clément Vinauger, an assistant professor of biochemistry at Virginia Tech. He recently tested four commonly used soaps and found that three increased humans’ attractiveness to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, while one — Native coconut and **vanilla** body wash — seemed to decrease it, probably because mosquitoes don’t like coconut oil. “The short answer is,” Vinauger said, “it’s a complex problem.”

**Attuned**
***V.合拍***
My ears are beginning to **attune** to the subtle differences in intonation.

**secretions**
***N.分泌液***
The excessive **secretion** of gastric juices in the gut causes ulcers.

**hydrate**
