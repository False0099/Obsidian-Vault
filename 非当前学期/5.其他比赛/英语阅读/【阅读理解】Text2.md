Albert Einstein once remarked that God is [[subtle]], but not [[【易忘】malicious]]. The material world, he thoughty was unpredictable. This made the world interesting but not [[【易忘】impenetrable]]. Einstein, who brought clarity to the deeply hidden, reasoned that“nature hides her secret because of her essential [[【易忘】loftiness]], but not [[【易忘】by means of]] trick". **1. Seen like this, science [[advances]] as much through what thinkers get right as what they get wrong**. A scientific theory aims to understand the world. **2.But it is only when nature reveals an error that it can be [[【易忘,易混淆】refine]] d.**

长难句：
1. 如此看来（Seen like thie），科学不仅来自于正确的理论，也（as）来自于错误的理论

2. 但这个理论只有当自然揭示它的错误的时候，才能得以完善。

Few understood this better than Freeman Dyson, an insightful and brilliant theoretical physicist. He was a cheerful [[heretic]] —for example, calling work on nuclear fusion a“[[welfare]] programme” for engineers. He was also [[absurdly]] wrong about global warming.**1. But his refusal to [[【易混淆confront,comfort】conform]] was essential to his view of a scientist as someone who produced theories that were right and wrong but believed in them with equal [[【易混淆】conviction]].**
长难句：
1. 但正是他拒绝从中的这一行为，这对他对科学家的看法（无论理论对错，都对此深信不疑）而言极其重要


Progress always involves making mistakes and then recognising them. That is because we are all struggling to understand why and how things are the way they are. **When Dyson considered the idea that the limit to an energy supply that a species could have is all of the starlight in their solar system, logic would [[【多义词】dictate]] that a [[sophisticated]] civilisation would build a structure to harness the entire power of its sun.** This seemed [[eccentric]] at the time. Yet in 2015 it was discovered that a star 1,500 light years away was being shielded by matter circling the star. The speculation was that this mass could be the [[elusive]] “Dyson Sphere”.

1. 当戴森提出：一个物种所能拥有的能量供应的极限是其星系中的所有星光这个想法的时候，依照逻辑推论，一个先进文明将会建造出一个结构来利用其太阳中的所有能量。

A scientist will be [[【易忘】leniently]] judged if misled by a false hypothesis. **Their [[reputation]], however, may not survive if the work is careless or if they claim to have discovered a fact that turns out to be wrong**. There is a concern, especially in social sciences and medicine, about the predominance of studies that have proved impossible to [[reproduce]]. If the original errors do not get corrected when scientists try to take the work further, then science’s capacity to remedy itself will be called into question. **There are questions here about the value system in academic publishing and the funding mechanisms that have led to too many researchers thinking it is fine to move on from mistakes without publicly acknowledging them.**
长难句：
1. 如果他们的工作做的不够到位或者他们宣称了一个事实但是之后却被认为是错误的，那么这些科学家就会名声扫地。
2. 在当前的价值评估，学术出版，资金机制种存在问题，他们使得太多研究者认为，可以不必公开承认错误，就能抛掉他们，继续前行。


Science must be self-correcting and allow for even its greatest [[practitioners]] to be wrong. History is [[【易忘，少见】littered]] with examples of major figures who [[erred]]. Charles Darwin is famous for his theory of evolution by natural selection but came up with a bizarre—and mistaken—theory to explain why inheritance is a random process. It was Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, who worked out the first set of rules of [[heredity]]. Mendel’s brilliance was unrecognised in his lifetime. He left science for God. In every century and every science there are brilliant [[blunder]]s. The trick is to learn from them.
