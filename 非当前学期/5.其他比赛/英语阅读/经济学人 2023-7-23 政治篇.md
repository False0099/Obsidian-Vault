Thailand’s **[[parliament]]** again voted to prevent Pita Limjaroenrat from becoming prime minister. Coupled with a court ruling that suspended the **opposition leader** from the **[[legislature]]**, Mr Pita now has no chance of getting the job. Although his **[[pro­democracy]]** Move Forward party claimed the most seats in a **general election** in May, Mr Pita has been blocked by the **upper house**, which **is [[stacked with]]** parties **[[【易忘】aligned with]]** Thailand’s conservative military elite. The Constitutional Court is even considering a complaint against Move Forward over its aim of reforming the country’s draconian lèse­majesté laws.


The **legislature** of a particular state or country is the group of people in it who have the power to make and pass laws.



A senior leader in Malaysia’s opposition alliance of parties, Perikatan Nasional, was charged with **sedition**. Muhammad Sanusi Md Nor is the chief co­ordinator of PN’s campaign ahead of forthcoming state elections. He was indicted under colonial­era laws for questioning decisions made by the king.
