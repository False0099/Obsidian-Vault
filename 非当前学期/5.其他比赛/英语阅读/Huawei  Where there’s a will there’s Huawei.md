**America’s technology blacklist has proven porous**

  

“**Genuinely** frightened” by Huawei. That was the **verdict** of Wilbur Ross, America’s commerce secretary, delivered recently to an audience of **diplomats**. The Chinese tech giant is the world’s biggest supplier of mobile-network equipment. American officials worry that it could use that position for electronic spying or **sabotage** on behalf of Beijing.

**Genuinely** 
Adv. 的确，确实
I'm **genuinely** sorry for what I said.

**verdict** [ˈvɜːdɪkt] n.(陪审团的) 裁定，裁决，裁断; (经过检验或认真考虑后的) 结论，意见

**sabotage** [ˈsæbətɑːʒ]  n/v.蓄意破坏,妨碍

  

With that in mind, in May Mr Ross’s department placed Huawei on the “entity list”, restricting the ability of American firms to do business with it. Many analysts expected the results to be painful. Huawei spends more than $10bn a year on buying software, **processors** and the like from American firms. So far, though, the pain has failed to **materialise**. Sales of Huawei’s smartphones, which can no longer ship with Google’s popular apps, have **flatlined** outside China. But on the whole, the firm seems in **robust** health. On October 16th it announced revenues of 611bn yuan ($89bn) for the first nine months of 2019, up by 24% year-on-year. It said it had signed over 60 contracts to install **zippy** 5g phone networks around the world.

**processor** 处理器

**materialise** v.（使） 成为事实

**flatline**  v.处于低潮; 没有起色;

**robust**
Adj. 茁壮的，强壮的
He looks **robust** and healthy enough.


**zippy**  迅捷的; 速度快的; 

  

Two things explain that resilience. The first is that **enforcement** has been less fierce than feared. On the same day that Mr Ross was describing his fears, his department issued its first set of licences permitting some American companies to restart sales to Huawei. Among the licensees was Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used in Huawei’s laptops.

**Enforcement**
n.执法、执行
Voters support the **enforcement** of immigration laws.
  

The second is that the law has proven more **porous** than expected. When Huawei was first placed on the entity list, it led to corporate panic. Lawyers at American tech firms dived into **obscure** **branches** of export law that their firms had never before had to consider. A leaked internal memo from Arm, a chip-design company based in Britain but with a big presence in America, created the perception that its licensing of crucial chip designs to Huawei had completely **ceased**. Yet after the dust had settled, many of the tech firms concluded that the international nature of their supply chains would allow them to carry on serving Huawei even without a special licence of the sort awarded to Microsoft.
  
**porous**
Adj. 多孔的，
**porous** soil with good drainage
adj. 松懈的
The border in this region is **porous** and many refugees have simply walked across.

**Obscure**
Adj. 无名的，默默的
an obscure 12th-century mystic
Adj. 晦涩的、不清楚的、模糊的
Official policy has changed, for reasons that remain obscure.
V.掩盖
Managers deliberately **obscured** the real situation **from** federal investigators.

**branches**
N.分支
I used to work in the local branch of a large bank.

**cease**
v.终止
Whether the protests will **cease** remains to be seen.

Nvidia, a chipmaking company based in Santa Clara, California, offers an example. The firm designs graphics processing units (gpus). These chips specialise in the **sorts** of mathematics required to draw **whizzy** graphics for modern video-games. A stroke of **serendipity** means they are also **well-suited** to artificial-intelligence work. But Nvidia does not physically make anything in America. Instead it sends its designs, which are not themselves subject to the export controls, to the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which undertakes the expensive, high-tech process of manufacturing the silicon. Under the law, that leaves Nvidia free to sell the resulting chips to Huawei.

**Sort**
N.种类
We both like the same **sort** of music.
V.整理
Paper, plastic, and cans are **sorted** for recycling.

**whizzy**
Adj. 高技术的
European companies have always been good at making **whizzy** gadgets.

**serendipity**
N.机缘、幸运


**well-suited** 适当的，很合适的

  

Many other American companies share this offshore-manufacturing structure. It exists because Western technology firms have largely **outsourced** manufacturing and **assembly** to countries such as Taiwan, which have built up large, specialised industries around the task. Only the highest margin design work is still undertaken at home. For Huawei, this counts as a happy accident. For American security **hawks**, it is **infuriating**.

**outsourced**
v.外包
Unions are fighting a plan by the university to outsource all non-academic services.

**assembly**
N.集合、聚集、与会者
the United Nations General Assembly
n、集体活动
All pupils are expected to attend school assembly.
n.组装
N...... 的总和
The frame needs to be strong enough to support the engine assembly.

**hawks**
N, 鹰派
v.叫卖
On every street corner there were traders hawking their wares.

**infuriating** [ɪnˈfjʊərieɪtɪŋ] adj.使人极为生气(或愤怒)的

  

The **status** **quo** may not last. The Department of Commerce is drawing up two lists of technologies, one “foundational” and one “emerging”, whose export will be subject to much more severe restrictions than those imposed by the entity list. Depending on how strictly the lists are drawn, the new rules could do serious damage.

**status quo** 现状; 原来的状况

  

In the meantime, though, the main effect of the sanctions seems to have been to accelerate Huawei’s push towards technological independence from America. Analysis of its phones by ubs, a bank, shows they now contain fewer American-sourced components (some appear to contain none at all). The firm has said that similar efforts are being made across the company. Huawei is still not immune to determined American action. But it is less vulnerable than it was.

**immune** [ɪˈmjuːn] 免除; 豁免，不受影响
