**A milk colossus gulps down two Australian producers**

  

This august Andrew Cohen, boss of Bellamy’s Organic, an Australian maker of **infant formula**, *enthused* to investors about having a brand “that’s loved in China”. So loved, in fact, that a few weeks later Mengniu Dairy, China’s second-biggest producer of milk products, said it wanted to buy Bellamy’s for A$1.5bn ($1bn). On December 5th its shareholders voted **in favour of** the deal.

**enthused** adj. 热情洋溢的

**infant formula**  婴儿配方奶粉

**in favour of** 赞成，支持

  

At first Bellamy’s seemed to be milking it, not Mengniu. An Australian government committee that *reviews* foreign acquisitions set out conditions: Mengniu must keep *headquarters* and most of the board Australian, and pour A $12m into local factories. Mengniu offered a 59% premium on the firm’s share price, which had *shed* three-fifths in the 18 months before the offer (it has rebounded a bit since). Mr Cohen blamed falling Chinese birth rates, a regulatory **hold-up on** imports and competition in China’s thirsty infant-formula market.

**headquarter** /'hɛd'kwɔrtɚ/ n.总部

**shed** n.棚  ***同义词：canopy   booth***
		v.去除 900 jobs will be shed over the next few months.
		
**hold-up** a.延误 Come on, let's go. What's the hold-up? ***同义词 ：delay***
			 

Now Mengniu looks like **the cat that got the cream**. It wasted no time in making another **bid** on November 25th to buy Lion Dairy & Drinks, Australia’s second-largest milk processor, for A$600m. The pair of acquisitions would hand it a rich **vat** of organic and premium brands that China’s middle class **covets**, including Farmers Union yogurt and licences to the Yoplait franchise. Mengniu can tap high-quality Aussie milk. And it is one in the eye for Yili, its bigger cross-town dairy rival in Hohhot, the regional capital of Inner Mongolia.

**bid** v.拍卖中出价 ***She knew she couldn't afford it, so she didn't bid.***
	  v.竞争 ***Paris is bidding to host the next Olympics.***
	 
**vat** n.一大桶，一大缸

**the cat that got the cream** 洋洋得意：overly pleased with oneself

**covet** /'kʌvɪt/ v.渴望;贪求

**covert** adj. 隐秘的

The two firms control about half of China’s dairy market. If it wins Lion, Mengniu **stands a chance** at **surpassing** Yili by **revenue** next year, reckons Song Liang, an independent dairy analyst (both want to make sales of 100bn yuan, or $14bn). They are expanding in South-East Asia, where Bellamy’s and Lion are already popular. Last year Yili acquired Thailand’s biggest ice-cream maker. In August it bought Westland Milk Products, a New Zealand co-operative. It **envisions** “a vast dairy bridge crossing the Pacific Ocean”.

**revenue** n.收益，收入 ***Taxes provide most of the government's revenue.***
同义词：income taxes proceed yield.
反义词: expenditure

**stands a chance at** 有机会...

**surpassing** adj. 超过，胜过 ***a face of surpassing beauty***
				   adv. 卓越的，非凡的 
同义词：remarkable excellent prominent superior
  

In a decade Chinese milk production will meet only half of domestic demand, says Terrance Liu of clsa, a broker, down from around 70% today. And, as Mengniu and its rival move overseas and upmarket, they need better ways to keep products **chilled** through production and transport, which **rich-world** firms can teach them. At home spending on formula per infant is rising thanks to declining rates of **breastfeeding** in many cities. A deadly **tainted** milk scandal in 2008 has put shoppers off local products. clsa estimates that four- fifths of Bellamy’s products have ended up in China thanks to a **flourishing** informal trade by so-called daigou, who buy products overseas and resell them online.

**chilled** adj. 放松的 ***Me, I'm feeling pretty chilled.***
			
**breastfeeding** n.哺育 ***A good diet is essential during breastfeeding.***
同义词： flourishing

**broker**  (股票、外汇或商品) 经纪人，代理商

**tainted milk scandal** 毒奶粉丑闻

  

New regulations have recently *crimped* grey-market sales. But Mengniu is expected to work out the import-clearance delay promptly: cofco Dairy, a state-owned giant, owns 24% of the Hong Kong-listed firm. China’s $62bn dairy market is still little more than a tenth of the world’s by value. But Euromonitor, a research firm, predicts that by 2022 it will overtake America as the globe’s biggest market for dairy. Welcome to the land of milk and money.

**crimped** adj. 压缩
