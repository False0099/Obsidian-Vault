In a decision that could further encourage European governments to [[take on]] large tech platforms, Germany's top court ruled on Tuesday that Facebook had abused its dominance in social media to illegally harvest data about its users.

The case had been closely watched after German regulators used a [[【多义词】novel]] [[【偶尔忘，多义词】interpretation]] of competition law to rule against the social media giant last year. The authorities said Facebook broke competition laws by combining data it collected about users across its different platforms, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as from outside websites and third-party apps. In Germany, Facebook now must alter how it processes data about its users. It was ordered to allow people to block the company from combining their Facebook data with information about their activities on other apps and websites.

The decision is a direct shot at Facebook’s business model, which relies on collecting reams of data about people in order to offer more targeted advertising. The authorities argued that Facebook unfairly used its dominance to collect data about millions of users of third-party sites that used tools like Facebook's“like” and “share” buttons, and an analytics service called Facebook Pixel. Regulators [[【易混淆include,联系conclusion】conclude]] that consumers faced a false choice: Agree to hand over vast amounts of personal data or not use Facebook's ubiquitous social media services at all.

“There are neither serious doubts about Facebook’s dominant position on the German social network market nor the fact that Facebook is abusing this dominant position," the court said.“As the market-dominating network operator, Facebook bears a special responsibility for maintaining still-existing competition in the social networking market."

Facebook is the latest tech company to suffer a regulatory setback. This month, the European Commission announced a formal [[【易混淆invest,invent,navigation】investigation]] of Apple over its treatment of third-party app developers Amazon is also under antitrust scrutiny in Brussels. In Washington, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are facing investigations by the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress
Germany's top antitrust enforcer, Andreas Mundt, has long pushed for regulators to be more aggressive in taking on Facebook and other tech giants. He has argued that Facebook uses the data it collects from users to strengthen its position over rivals, harming competition.

On Tuesday, Mr. Mundt cheered the court decision, saying data is one of the most valuable assets in the digital economy and must be a central part of antitrust enforcement. He said the court's decision “provides important information on how we should deal with the issue of data and competition in the future.”
“Data are an essential factor for economic strength, and a decisive criterion in assessing online market power," Mr. Mundt said in a statement.“Whenever data are collected and used in an unlawful way, it must be possible to intervene under antitrust law to avoid an abuse of market power."
