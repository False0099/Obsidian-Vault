③Keumjoo Kwak, a psychology professor at Seoul National University, says school bullying and school violence have always existed in South Korea, but the methods used have become more sophisticated and malicious , **imitating** scenes from films and using social media to spread the harm. Victims often believe they cannot resolve the problem of school bullying, which negatively affects their physical and mental health. It can lead to academic decline and long-term avoidance of attending school, or even dropping out . Kwak says the competitive and high-pressure environment many students in South Korea face can intensify the problem of bullying. She says students are **subjected** to intense academic pressure and long hours of studying, primarily centred on university entrance exams . This creates a highly competitive, hierarchical , and **monotonous** environment **devoid** of physical activities to expend energy – and that can lead to some individuals bullying others “as a source of amusement”.

If we leave them as they are, they will continue to harm others as adults.” Kwak also points to preventive education from a young age and the need to teach empathy, cooperation, and respect for others. “Without **implementing** such measures, South Korea will continue to face dreadful cases of school violence every year.”
