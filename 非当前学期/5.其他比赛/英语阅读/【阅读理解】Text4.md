On Monday, the Supreme Court voted to allow a years-long [[【常见】antitrust]] case against Apple to move forward, despite Apple's [[【易忘，易混】objection]]s. The case, Apple Inc. v. Pepper, [[【多义词】concerns]] a group of iPhone users who [[accuse]] Apple of [[【易忘】driving up]] the price of apps by charging third-party app developers a 30 percent [[【易忘】commission]]. Apple argued that App Store customers technically buy apps from third-party developers and have no direct purchasing relationship with Apple, and therefore no standing to seek damages from the company. But in a 5-4 decision, written by [[【常见】conservative]] Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the court voted against Apple, allowing the case to [[【易忘，多义词】proceed]].

“The [[sole]] question presented at this early stage of the case is whether these consumers are proper [[【易忘】plaintiffs]] for this kind of antitrust suit—in particular, our [[precedents]] ask whether the consumers were “direct purchasers’ from Apple,” the decision reads.“It is [[【易忘】undisputed]] that the iPhone owners bought the apps directly from Apple."

The decision was [[【易忘】hailed]] by consumer [[【易忘】advocates]] like the Center for Democracy & Technology “Today, more and more of consumers’ purchases go through platforms, where sellers and buyers meet virtually via technology, instead of in brick-and- [[【易忘，少见】mortar]] stores," Avery Gardiner, CDT's [[【多义词，易忘】senior]] [[fellow]] for competition, data and power, said in a statement.“These technologies are [[evolve]] ing fast, and today's decision shows that [[【常见】antitrust]] law is—as it should be—flexible enough to address [[【易忘】allegation]] s  that companies may [[misuse ]]their market strength in [[【多义词】novel]] ways."

The Supreme Court's decision to allow the case to [[【易忘，多义词】proceed]] could also have an impact on other companies, like Amazon, that prefer to [[【多义词】frame]] themselves as neutral marketplaces, not direct sellers.“I would anticipate that [[【易忘】plaintiffs]]’ lawyers will be looking at this closely and looking at tech companies and internet platforms and thinking about who they might be able to [[sue]] now that this uncertainty is gone," says Valarie Williams, a partner at the law firm Alston & Bird.

The Supreme Court's decision [[【易忘】hinges]] on another 1977 case, Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, in which the Supreme Court ruled that indirect purchasers cannot seek antitrust damages, a [[principle]] now known as the Illinois Brick [[doctrine]]. Apple used this same [[doctrine]] to argue that the [[【易忘】plaintiffs]] in this case also [[lacked]] standing. Apple positioned itself as [[merely]] the [[retail]] space where app developers pay to set up shop and sell their products. But in their decision the Supreme Court justices rejected this [[framing]], writing that Apple was arguing“[[strenuously]]” against a“simple [[conclusion]]”.“There is no [[intermediary]] in the distribution chain between Apple and the consumer," the decision reads.“The iPhone owners purchase apps directly from the retailer Apple, who is the [[【易忘】allege]] [[【常见】antitrust]] violator,"

Tech companies and consumer [[【易忘】advocates]] have been watching this case closely, [[bracing]] themselves for a [[ripple]] effect across the industry. But Williams says the court's decision in this case largely avoids [[drastic]] [[reinterpretation]] of the law. It does not, for instance, [[overturn]] the Illinois Brick doctrine by finding that indirect purchasers of a product have standing to [[sue]] for antitrust violations.[ 505 words]
