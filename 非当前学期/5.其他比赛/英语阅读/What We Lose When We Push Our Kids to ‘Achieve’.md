①When I was 12, I **disappeared into** my bedroom with a $40 folk guitar and a giant book of Beatle songs, with elementary , large-type *“E-Z” chord diagrams* to follow. I had no musical gift , as a series of failed music lessons had *assured* me, and no real musical training. **Nonetheless** , I **worked my way** through “Rain” ( abbreviated to two chords) and “Love Me Do” (three) and finally “Yellow Submarine” (four chords, or was it five?) and discovered by myself the matchless thrill of homemade musical harmony. 
②Fifty years later, I am still not a very good guitar player, but that week’s work, and the months and years of *self-directed* practice on the instrument that followed it, became a *touchstone* of *sorts* for me and a model and foundation for almost every meaningful thing I’ve done since . It gave me confidence, often *wavering* but never entirely extinguished , that perseverance and passion and patience can make one master any task . ***So it seems suitable at this season, as the school year ends and graduates walk out into the world, most thinking hard about what they might do with their lives, to talk about a distinction that I first glimpsed in that room and in those chord patterns.*** It’s the difference between achievement and accomplishment. 
③ Achievement is the completion of the task imposed from outside. Accomplishment is the end point of an engulfing activity we’ve chosen, whose reward is the sudden rush of fulfillment. Our social world often *conspires* to *denigrate* accomplishment **in favor of** the *rote* work of achievement. All our observation tells us that young people, particularly, are perpetually being pushed toward the next test or the “best” grammar school , high school or college they can get into. We drive these young people toward achievement, tasks that lead only to other tasks, into something *resembling* not so much a rat race as a rat maze . 
④My own accomplishment of learning those Beatles songs seems to echo in the experience of almost everyone I know. My wife **recalls** learning to sew her own clothes by the same process I undertook — breaking it down into small, manageable tasks, getting the pattern , choosing the fabric , working the machine, until you find yourself making something like music — in the clothing maker’s case, wearing that beautiful thing you’ve made. The experience of breaking down and building up that she learned then informed her later professional work as a film editor and producer. Most often these early self-directed obsessions produce not a job to earn from but a platform to leap from — they produce a sense of fulfillment through passionate perseverance that crosses over into the most seemingly alien enterprises . Losing ourselves in an all-absorbing action, we become ourselves.
